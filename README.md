# Introduction

This is the 4<sup>th</sup> homework in the *NoSQL Databases and Advanced Programming* course which I participated in during the 2020/21 summer term. Students were supposed to present their skills in working with a locally hosted **RiakKV** database.



# Solution

Due to grading requirements the structure of the directory is as follows:

* there are 10 short questions/problems for which all *curl* requests must be stored in one text file (the *zadania_1_10.txt* file), whereas responses from a database must be stored in separate text files (the *zadanie_<task_no>\_zwrotka.txt* files)
  1. Create a bucket. Upload 5 values to the bucket. Each value should be a JSON document with at least 4 key-value pairs.
  2. Get one of the values added in step no. 1.
  3. Modify one of the values from step no. 1 by adding a new field.
  4. Modify one of the values from step no. 1 by deleting a field.
  5. Modify one of the values from step no. 1 by updating a field.
  6. Delete one document from the bucket.
  7. Try to get a value that doesn't exist.
  8. Add one document without specifying its key.
  9. Get the document added in the previous step.
  10. Delete the document added in step no. 8.
* there is one problem that needs to be solved using a script written in one of the following programming languages: Python, Ruby, Java, Bash, Scala. The script should do the following:
  * add a document to a database
  * download and print the document to the console
  * modify the document
  * delete the document from the database
  * try to get the document
